    hero.title: Our Story
    hero.subtitle: A neighborhood bakery with roots in tradition.
    story.title: Three Generations of Baking
    story.paragraph1: Maple Street Bakery was founded in 1987 by Anna and Marcus Chen, who brought their family recipes from their hometown in Europe. What started as a tiny storefront has grown into a beloved neighborhood institution.
    story.paragraph2: Today, their granddaughter Sarah continues the tradition, using the same recipes, the same techniques, and the same commitment to quality that made Maple Street famous.
    story.paragraph3: We still start baking at 3am every day to ensure everything is fresh when we open. No shortcuts, no preservatives — just real ingredients and real craft.
    values.title: What We Believe
    values.fresh: "Fresh Daily - Everything is baked from scratch each morning"
    values.local: "Local First - We source ingredients from local farms when possible"
    values.community: "Community - More than a bakery, we're a neighborhood gathering place"
